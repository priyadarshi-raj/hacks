				<h3> 0-16.0 BMI (kg/m2)</h3>
				<p><b>Underweight (Severe thinness)</b><br> Moderate and severe thinness – A BMI less than 17.0 indicates moderate and severe thinness in adult populations. 
                    It has been clearly linked to increases in illness in adults studied in three continents; therefore, 
                    it is a reasonable value to choose as a cut-off point for moderate risk. A BMI less than 16.0 is known to be associated with a markedly increased risk for ill-health, poor physical performance, lethargy and even death; therefore, this cut-off point is a valid extreme limit. <a href="">visit more!!!!!</a></p>

				<h3>16.0 – 16.9 BMI (kg/m2)</h3>
				<p><b>Underweight (Moderate thinness)</b>The cut-off point of a BMI of 18.5 for underweight in both genders has less experimental validity as a cut-off point for moderate and severe thinness, but is a reasonable value for use pending further comprehensive studies. The proportion of the population with a low BMI that is considered to be a public health problem is closely linked to the resources available for correcting the problem, the stability of the environment and government priorities. About 3–5% of a healthy adult population has a BMI <18.5.<br><a href="">Read vlogs</a></p>

				<h3>25.0 – 29.9 BMI (kg/m2)</h3>
				<p><b>Overweight </b>Overweight – A BMI ≥25 signifies overweight; it is a major determinant of many NCDs (e.g. non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and stroke), and it increases the risks for several types of cancer, gallbladder disease, musculoskeletal disorders and respiratory symptoms. In some populations, the metabolic consequences of weight gain start at modest levels of overweight..<br><a href="">calculate now!!!</a></p>
